# GifTastic

Application implements the GIPHY API to make a dynamic we page that populates with GIFS of your choice through the use of a search bar. 

Upon searching, a button will be created that will allow the user to click to view GIFS in a static state. Clicking on the static image will initate the GIF, and clicking again will pause. 

## Before You Begin

 **Hit the GIPHY API**.
   * Fool around with the GIPHY API. [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy).
   * Be sure to read about these GIPHY parameters (hint, hint): 
     * `q`
     * `limit`
     * `rating`
   * Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. For now, you can use their [public API key](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#public-beta-key).
   * Make sure you switch the protocol in the query URL from **`http to https`**, or the app may not work properly when deployed to Heroku.
